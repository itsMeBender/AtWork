# Contributing 

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to the source.  

Currently the function of the Web App works perfectly for me. I have no plans to add more functionallity.  
But I can imagine that it can be improved;

* in coding
* in testing
* in solving bugs
* in documentation
* in functionallity, adding project task timers, alarms
* or maybe merging with existing tools

## History 

Years ago I developed a website to keep track of my working hours for clients and projects. It had reporting functions and billing. It was so old (in internet years) that it run out of PHP support. So I decided to create a simplere version, but as a Web App, using Polymer.

Interested?

Maybe we can bend the rules ... ;)
