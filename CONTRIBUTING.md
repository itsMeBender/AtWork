Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to the source.  
Currently the project is so small, without any goal. 
That it's difficult to say, how to contribute.

Currently the function of the Web App works perfectly for me.
But I can imagine that it can be improved;

* in coding
* in testing
* in documentation
* in functionallity
* or maybe merging with existing tools

Maybe we need to bend the rules ... ;)
